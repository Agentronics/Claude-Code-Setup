# Using Claude Code with Gemini / Qwen Models (Free)

This guide explains how to use **Claude Code** with **Gemini** or **Qwen** models for free by routing requests through a compatible model router.

## Overview

Claude Code is an AI coding interface originally designed for Anthropic models. By using a model router, you can redirect Claude Code requests to alternative LLMs like **Gemini** or **Qwen**, enabling free or low-cost usage.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed  
- Access to Gemini or Qwen API (free tier)  
- A compatible model router (e.g., Claude Code Router)

## Setup Steps

1. Install and configure the model router  
2. Add your Gemini or Qwen API keys to the router configuration  
3. Map Claude Code’s default model to Gemini or Qwen  
4. Start the router and launch Claude Code

## Supported Models

- **Gemini** (Google)  
- **Qwen** (Alibaba)

## Use Cases

- Free AI-assisted coding  
- Code review and refactoring  
- Prototyping and experimentation

## Notes

- Model capabilities may differ from Claude  
- Free tiers may include rate and usage limits
